# VThree = Vecty + Three.js
====

This is a temporary replacement for https://github.com/vecty/vthree, which uses github.com/lngramos/three, that seems to be slow with PR acceptance, so I need to use my fork.
Once the fork is synced with upstrea, it's ok to remove this subpackage and switch back to github.com/vecty/vthree.
